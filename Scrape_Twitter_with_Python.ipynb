        "\n",
        "- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Twitter) is a major announcement hub where people and companies publish their announcements. This is a great opportunity to use Twitter to follow industry trends. For example, stock market or crypto market targets could be scraped to predict the future price of a stock or crypto.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Twitter is also a great source of data for sentiment analysis. You can use Twitter to find out what people think about a certain topic or brand. This is useful for market research, product development, and brand awareness.\n",

        "- So, if we can scrape Twitter data with Python we can have access to this valuable public information for free!"

        "  - We'll also take a look at reverse engineering Twitter's hidden API.\n",
